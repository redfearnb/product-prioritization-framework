# MCDA Strategic Decision Framework ⚖️

A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool designed to remove subjectivity from high-stakes resource allocation.

### 🧬 PhD-Level Prioritization
Subjective roadmapping leads to resource waste. This framework applies mathematical weighting across six strategic dimensions:
1.  **Customer Value (25%)**
2.  **Strategic Fit (20%)**
3.  **Business Value (20%)**
4.  **Technical Feasibility (15%)**
5.  **Compliance/Security (10%)**
6.  **Time to Value (10%)**

### 🚀 Business Impact
